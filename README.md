# Image Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying images of cats and dogs. The goal is to build a binary classification model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs based on their features.

## Kaggle Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the SVM model is sourced from Kaggle. It includes a collection of labeled images, with each image belonging to either the "cat" or "dog" class.

**Kaggle Dataset Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

Please download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory before running the code.

## Model Used
We have implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for image classification. SVMs are powerful classifiers that work well for both linear and non-linear data. In this case, the SVM will be trained to learn the patterns and features that distinguish cats from dogs in the provided images.

The model is trained on the labeled dataset, and its performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
